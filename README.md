# Discover Dog Breeds

This app allows the user to discover more information about different breeds of dogs. The app allows users to view lists of dog breeds from A to Z. From the lists, the user can select a particular dog breed to view further information. The information comes from the American Kennel Club's website about dog breeds. The app keeps track of the breeds viewed and displays that list to the user upon exiting the app.

## Installation

To install it yourself as:

``$ gem install discover-dog-breeds``

## Usage

To use the app, after installation type ``discover-dog-breeds`` from a terminal or command prompt. The app asks the user to enter a letter from A to Z. After entering a letter a list of dog breeds for that letter is shown. If none exist for a letter the user is notified and asked to make another selection. After finding a list of dog breeds, the user has an opportunity to view more details by typing the number that corresponds to the list position of a particular dog breed. The details are displayed and the user has an opportunity to continue to select more dog breeds to view or to exit the app. The app will display a list of dog breeds viewed upon exiting.

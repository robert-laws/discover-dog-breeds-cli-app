 # Specifications for the CLI Assessment
  
Specs:

[x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application -> created a CLI class that outputs messages to the console and expects input from the user

[x] Pull data from an external source -> I use Nokogiri to scrape the website http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds and pull data to display to the user

[x] Implement both list and detail views -> I display a list view of dog breed names and a detail view of one selected dog breed
